\noindent I, student of Sharda University, Greater Noida, have taken efforts in this project. However, it would not have been possible without the kind support and help of many individuals and organizations. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all of them.\\

\noindent The author is highly grateful to Dr. R.M. Mehra, Sharda University, Greater Noida for providing him with the opportunity to carry out his Six Months Internship at STMicroelectronics, Greater Noida.\\

\noindent The constant guidance and encouragement received from Dr. Pallavi gupta, ECE Co-ordinator, Sharda University, has been of great help in carrying out the training program and is duly acknowledged.\\

\noindent The author would like to whole heartedly thank Mr. Saurabh Rawat and Mr. Raunaque Quaiser for their constant guidance and direction. Without their help and motivation, it would not have been possible for this internship to go as smoothly and rewardingly as it did.\\
